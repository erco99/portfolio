# Understanding the Internet part 1: the hardware infrastructure

## Introduction

This is the first article of a series in which I will explore all the elements that compose the modern global Internet, from the hardware that 
provides the physical infrastructure to the operating systems and how they handle communication.

The purpose of this series is purely personal: to organize my knowledge in this particulaar field and to deepen my understanding of 
those areas where I feel less confident and need further clarification.

To everyone who will read these articles, I hope you will find them useful and that they will help expand and/or improve your knowledge in this field.

## A Brief History of Early Computers

As with all historical topics, let's start with a little bit of context. Skipping smoke signals, the telegraph, 
the telephone, and the radio, we soon reach the era of communication between computers.  

As most people know, **ENIAC** is considered the first digital electronic computer. However, it **was not based on the Von Neumann architecture**.  

There is often confusion when discussing the first computers because the lists of **pure Von Neumann machines** 
and **stored-program computers** overlap but are not identical. Some Von Neumann computers were not fully stored-program, 
and some stored-program computers were not fully Von Neumann.

The early history of **connections between computers** is a gradual evolution from isolated machines to true computer-to-computer networking. Rather than appearing suddenly, networking emerged from existing telecommunications technologies and conceptual breakthroughs.

### Early networking

The first electronic computers—such as **ENIAC**, **EDSAC**, and the **Manchester Baby** 
were completely isolated systems.

- Programs and data were entered manually (switches, punched cards, paper tape)
- Output was produced locally
- No real-time communication with other machines

At this stage, computers were standalone calculation devices.

The first step toward networking was **remote access**, not computer-to-computer communication.

- A central computer was connected to multiple remote terminals
- Terminals were not computers, only input/output devices
- Communication used telephone lines or dedicated circuits

### Modems and Telephone Infrastructure

Early computer networking grew out of the need to connect digital computers using an infrastructure built for analog voice, namely 
the **public switched telephone network**, which was circuit-switched and limited to narrow audio frequencies.

Because computers are digital, modems (modulator–demodulators) were invented in the 1950s and 1960s to convert bits into audible 
tones and back again, enabling data transmission at very low speeds over phone line:

- Converted digital signals to analog for transmission
- Converted analog signals back to digital at the receiver
- Enabled data transmission over standard phone lines

Connections were still:
- Point-to-point
- Slow
- Expensive

But this was a crucial technical prerequisite for networking.

### Packet Switching
Packet switching emerged in the 1960s as a radical alternative to circuit-switched telephone networks, proposing that 
digital data be broken into small packets that travel independently across a shared network and are reassembled at the 
destination, an idea developed independently by Paul Baran in the United States and Donald Davies in the United Kingdom 
to improve efficiency and resilience; unlike telephone circuits, packet-switched networks do not reserve a dedicated path, 
allowing many computers to share the same links and enabling the network to continue operating even if parts fail,

### ARPANET
ARPANET was revolutionary because it used packet switching rather than traditional circuit switching. Research by 
Paul Baran and Donald Davies showed that dividing data into packets and routing them dynamically would:

- Use network capacity more efficiently
- Avoid single points of failure
- Allow multiple conversations to share the same links

This design was critical for a research network where traffic was bursty and unpredictable.

Instead of connecting computers directly to each other, ARPANET introduced **Interface Message Processors (IMPs)**, 
which acted as early routers. Each site connected its host computer to an IMP, and IMPs communicated with one another 
over leased telephone lines.

ARPANET initially used the Network Control Protocol (NCP), which worked well within a single network but could not easily 
connect multiple networks together. As new packet-switched networks emerged (satellite, radio, local networks), this limitation became clear.

Each host computer connected directly to an IMP, which acted as a packet switch. The IMPs handled all line signaling, packetization, 
error checking, and routing. The communication between IMPs over the leased lines was purely digital, so modems weren’t necessary.

### LANs and Ethernet
Local Area Networks (LANs) emerged in the 1970s as a solution to connect multiple computers within a limited geographic area, 
such as a building, office, or campus, enabling high-speed communication, low latency, and resource sharing like files, printers, and later Internet access.

Early LAN research at Xerox PARC explored ways to efficiently link personal computers in a single workspace, leading to 
the invention of Ethernet by Robert Metcalfe and David Boggs in 1973, which used a shared coaxial cable and implemented 
Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) to manage simultaneous transmissions, allowing multiple 
devices to communicate without dedicated point-to-point links.

Ethernet initially operated at 2.94 Mbps and became standardized as IEEE 802.3 in 1983, which ensured compatibility across 
manufacturers and facilitated widespread adoption. Over time, the technology evolved with twisted-pair cabling, star topologies, 
and switches, increasing speeds from 10 Mbps to 100 Mbps (Fast Ethernet), then 1 Gbps (Gigabit Ethernet), and 
eventually 10–400 Gbps for modern enterprise networks.

LANs and Ethernet fundamentally transformed computing, enabling offices to move from centralized mainframes to personal computers, 
supporting collaboration and centralized management, and ultimately providing the foundation for enterprise networks that could 
later connect to wide-area networks and the global Internet.

### TCP/IP

In the early ARPANET, computers communicated using the Network Control Protocol (NCP), which allowed hosts to send packets 
within the ARPANET but could not connect different types of networks, limiting interoperability.

By the mid-1970s, researchers recognized the need for a universal protocol that could link heterogeneous networks, 
including ARPANET, packet radio networks, and satellite networks. Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn proposed a new protocol suite, 
Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), which separated concerns into two layers: IP for addressing and 
routing packets across networks, and TCP for ensuring reliable end-to-end delivery, error checking, and sequencing.

After years of testing and refinement, ARPANET conducted experiments in the late 1970s and early 1980s to run TCP/IP 
alongside NCP, gradually verifying its stability and compatibility.

On January 1, 1983, ARPANET officially transitioned from NCP to TCP/IP, requiring all hosts and IMPs to adopt the new protocols, 
effectively creating the first internetworked network-of-networks. This transition allowed different networks to interconnect 
seamlessly and laid the foundation for the modern Internet, establishing TCP/IP as the universal protocol suite still in use today.

### Domain Name System (DNS)

As the number of hosts grew, manually maintaining a centralized hosts file became infeasible. In 1984 DNS introduced a distributed, 
hierarchical namespace that mapped human-readable domain names to IP addresses, using a tree of authoritative name servers 
and caching resolvers. The system relies on a recursive and iterative query mechanism, zone delegation, and a caching architecture 
to achieve scalability and fault tolerance. By decoupling logical identifiers from physical addresses, DNS allowed transparent 
mobility, dynamic addressing, and hierarchical administration, which were essential for the exponential growth of TCP/IP networks.

### NSFNET

In 1986 the NSFNET backbone was constructed to provide high-speed connectivity between regional networks using T1 (1.5 Mbps) and later T3 (45 Mbps) 
links. It implemented packet-switched routing based on TCP/IP, with the backbone operating as a multi-protocol backbone to 
support IP, TCP, and emerging application protocols. NSFNET introduced redundant core routing, hierarchical addressing, and 
performance monitoring, enabling large-scale experimentation with inter-domain routing and congestion control. The backbone 
provided a testbed for scalable routing protocols such as OSPF and BGP, which would later underpin global Internet routing.

### Open standardization and the IETF

In the late 80s the formation of the IETF formalized a community-driven approach to protocol standardization. Technical specifications were 
documented in RFCs, which rigorously defined protocol behavior, packet formats, state machines, and error-handling semantics. 
This process enabled iterative refinement, backward compatibility testing, and early implementation in experimental networks. 
By prioritizing open specifications, modular protocol design, and interoperability, the IETF ensured that TCP/IP could evolve 
with emerging transport-layer and application-layer protocols without requiring centralized authority.

### The decommissioning of ARPANET

ARPANET’s shutdown in 1990 reflected the migration of packet-switched networking from a government-controlled research network to 
broader academic and commercial infrastructure. From a technical standpoint, ARPANET had pioneered routing algorithms, congestion 
control, and internetworking mechanisms. Its legacy includes the TCP/IP stack’s adoption, decentralized name resolution experiments, 
and the deployment of redundant, fault-tolerant nodes. Decommissioning also allowed for the expansion of NSFNET and private backbones, 
which could implement higher-capacity routers, link aggregation, and more sophisticated traffic engineering.

### World Wide Web

Tim Berners-Lee’s Web was implemented in 1991 as an application-layer protocol suite over TCP/IP, introducing HTTP for stateless 
client-server communication, HTML for structured hypertext documents, and URIs for unique resource identification. 
The Web relied on TCP’s reliable byte-stream abstraction to provide consistent content delivery across heterogeneous networks. 
The architecture emphasized hypermedia as a linking mechanism, enabling distributed information retrieval without modifying 
the underlying transport or network layers. This separation of concerns allowed applications to evolve independently while leveraging 
the global TCP/IP infrastructure.

### Graphical web browsers (1993)

The emergence of graphical browsers like Mosaic leveraged the HTTP/HTML stack to render text, images, and hyperlinks within an integrated 
interface. From a networking perspective, these browsers introduced persistent TCP connections, client-side caching, and support 
for multiple concurrent requests to optimize latency. They also encouraged the adoption of emerging standards, such as inline 
images (GIF), table-based layouts, and eventually scripting extensions. The graphical layer highlighted the importance of application-level 
protocols for usability while revealing performance limitations of TCP/IP under high-volume, interactive workloads.

### Commercialization of the Internet (1995)

The transition to commercial Internet backbones required ISPs to implement inter-domain routing using BGP, address allocation through 
IANA and RIRs, and service-level agreements to guarantee connectivity and throughput. This era also saw the emergence of network management 
practices, including SNMP monitoring, routing policies, and Quality of Service experimentation. The commercialization phase accelerated 
deployment of high-capacity fiber links, redundant routing, and scalable DNS infrastructure, transforming the Internet into a high-availability, 
multi-tenant network supporting heterogeneous applications from email to e-commerce.

### The modern Internet

The contemporary Internet operates as a globally distributed, multi-layered system with heterogeneous access networks, mobile devices, 
and cloud infrastructures. Core technologies include IPv4/IPv6, TCP congestion control, BGP for inter-domain routing, and 
application-layer protocols such as HTTP/HTTPS, SMTP, and emerging streaming protocols. Overlay networks, CDNs, and edge computing optimize 
latency and throughput, while wireless protocols and IoT frameworks extend connectivity to billions of devices. The modern Internet exemplifies 
scalable, fault-tolerant design, layered modularity, and end-to-end principles that originated with TCP/IP.
