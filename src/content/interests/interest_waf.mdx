## Wellness and Fitness

I try to balance my work, hobbies, and sports in order to stay fit and healthy.

- Running: supported by my Garmin Forerunner 955, I mostly run in Zone 2, trying to progressively improve my technique and endurance. I also got closer to trail running recently. I track and analyze my sessions 
on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/140866167)
- Calisthenics & Weights: I’ve been training for many years and have developed my own personal training philosophy. My goal is to maintain as much muscle mass as possible while combining strength training with endurance work.
- Other sports: from time to time, I also play basketball and tennis.

I’m currently planning to buy a road bike to begin my triathlon journey.
